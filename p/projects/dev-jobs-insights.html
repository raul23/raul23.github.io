    <p class="lead"><span id="scroll-here"></span>The <b>main goal</b> of this project is to extract interesting insights from developer
        job posts <b>@ Stack Overflow</b>.</p>

    <p><a href="https://github.com/raul23/dev-jobs-insights">dev-jobs-insights</a> is a data mining project written in
        <b>Python3</b> with the main objective of extracting meaningful insights from developer job posts. These insights
        can help us in getting a more accurate picture of what the developer job market looks like so we can make better
        decisions (e.g. what technologies to focus on to increase our chance of finding a job).
    </p>

    <p>
        Data visualization is an important tool in interpreting data. Thus graphs and maps are an important aspect of
        this project <!-- as you can see from the multiple graphs generated --> so we can see the developer job market
        across different dimensions (e.g. salary, industries, locations).
    </p>

    <p>Currently, the raw jobs data comes from <b>Stack Overflow</b>, but eventually other jobs sites will be integrated.
        The job posts data are mined from Stack Overflow's developer jobs
        <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/feed" >RSS feed</a> and <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/jobs">
            website</a>.

    <h2><span id="sources_of_jobs_data"></span>1. Sources of jobs data</h2>
    <h3><span id="rss_jobs_feed"></span>1.1 Stack Overflow's RSS jobs feed</h3>
    <p>The first source of jobs data is the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/feed">Stack Overflow's RSS jobs
    feed</a> which provides a total of 1000 entries (i.e. job posts). Almost every day, the feed gets updated with new
    job posts. The Python <a href="https://github.com/kurtmckee/feedparser"><code>feedparser</code></a> module is used
        for parsing the RSS feed which can also parse Atom feeds.</p>

    <p>The most relevant attributes from each feed's entry are extracted such as the <code>id</code>, <code>title</code>,
        <code>published_parsed</code>, <code>tags</code>, <code>link</code>, and <code>location</code>. The
        <b><code>id</code></b> is actually the job post's id, and extra processing is performed on
        <b><code>published_parsed</code> </b> (of type <code>time.struct_time</code>) to convert the UTC
        <code>datetime</code> to local time. The <b><code>tags</code></b> attribute is a list of names designating
        skills (a.k.a. technologies) required for the given job post such as java, python, .net and agile.</p>

    <p><span id="table01"></span>These are the relevant attributes extracted from the feed into an SQLite database:</p>
    <table class="style_table">
        <caption><b>Table 1</b> Relevant attributes extracted from the RSS jobs feed

    <br/>

    <h3><span id="developer_jobs_website"></span>1.2 Stack Overflow's developer jobs website</h3>
    <p>The second source of jobs data comes from <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/jobs">Stack Overflow's developer jobs</a>.
    The entry's <code>link</code> from the RSS feed is used to get the corresponding job post's webpage. From the
    webpage, we can get a lot more data about the job post that we couldn't get <b>directly</b> from the RSS feed such
        as the job post salary, its industries, and the company size.</p>

    <p>The Python module <a href="https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/"><code>BeautifulSoup4</code></a> was
        used for parsing the webpage HMTL and extracting the relevant data. The webpage is parsed in order by extracting
        first the title, company name, job location, salary, roles, industries, and technologies. However, if some data
        (e.g. author, location) was already present in the RSS feed's entry, the extraction is skipped for that
        particular data.</p>

    <p>All the extracted data from the RSS feed and webpages are stored in an SQLite database ready to be used for
        performing data analysis as explained in the section <a href="#data_analyzers">Data analyzers</a>.</p>

    <h2><span id="pipeline_for_maps_and_graphs"></span>2. Pipeline for generating the maps and graphs</h2>

    order:
    <ol>
        <li><a href="#rss_jobs_reader">RSS jobs reader</a>
            <ul>
                <li><b>input:</b> RSS jobs feed</li>

        </li>
    </ol>

    <br/>

    <h3><span id="rss_jobs_reader"></span>2.1 RSS jobs reader</h3>
    <p>The first stage in the pipeline is the RSS jobs reader which takes as input the Stack Overflow's RSS jobs feed. It is
    built based on the Python module <code>feedparser</code> which does the parsing of the feed. The entries (one entry
        = one job post) in the feed are extracted and loaded into an SQLite database, see <a href="#table01">Table 1</a>
        for a list of some of the attributes extracted.</p>
    <p>Multiple Stack Overflow's RSS jobs feeds can be read but any entry that was already parsed will be skipped.
        <!-- TODO: new feature -->An interesting feature to implement in the future would be to use the <code>updated</code>
        attribute to check if the entry was recently updated and if it is the case, update the entry's attributes in the
        database.</p>

    <br/>

    <h3><span id="web_scraper"></span>2.2 Web scraper</h3>
    <p>The second stage in the pipeline is the <b>web scraper</b> which takes initially as input the SQLite database with
        the parsed RSS feed from the previous stage. Each entry's <code>url</code> is used for getting the job post's
        webpage which is parsed using the python module <a href="https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/">
            <code>BeautifulSoup4</code></a>. The webpage is parsed in order by extracting relevant attributes from the
        top to the bottom. Along the way, relevant attributes are extracted only if they were not already extracted from
        the RSS feed. See <a href="#table02">Table 2</a> for a list of some of the attributes extracted from each job
        post's webpage.
    </p>

    <br/>

    <h3><span id="data_cleaner_and_loader"></span>2.3 Data cleaner and loader</h3>
    <p>The third stage in the pipeline is the <b>data cleaner and loader</b> which takes as input the scraped data from
        the web scraper in the previous step. Before the scraped data is loaded into the database, the data is cleaned
        up by <a href="#remove_non_informative_job_locations">removing any non-informative job locations</a> and
        <a href="#renaming_industries">renaming industries to standardized names.</a></p>

    <br/>

    <h4><span id="remove_non_informative_job_locations"></span>2.3.1 Removing non-informative job locations</h4>
    <p>
        Some job posts have job locations that don't provide more information
        compared to their other job locations that they are already associated with.
        Thus, these non-informative locations are ignored to avoid artificially
        increasing the count of a particular job location. Here are the cases that are
        treated:
    </p>
        <ol>
        <li>
        A job post has two locations with the same country but one location only
        consists of the country while the other location consists of the country and another component (city and/or
            region). In this case, the location with only the country is ignored.
            Example, if a job post has the locations "<b>Germany</b>" and "<b>Fulda, Germany</b>", only
        the latter location is kept in order to avoid inflating the job location
        "Germany".
        </li>
        <li>
        Keep the location with the correct spelling. For example, if a job post has the
            locations "<b>Hlavní <u>msto</u> Praha, CZ</b>" and "<b>Hlavní <u>město</u> Praha, CZ</b>",
            only the latter location is kept.
        </li>
        <li>
        A job post has two locations with the same city and country except one has
        also a region. The location that provides all components (city, region, country)
            is kept. For example, if a job post has the locations "<b>Toronto, CA</b>" and
        "<b>Toronto, ON, CA"</b>, only the latter location is kept.
        </li>
        </ol>

    <br/>

    <h4><span id="renaming_industries"></span>2.3.2 Renaming industries</h4>
    <p>Some names of industries were almost identical that they were renamed to a standardized name:</p>

    <table class="style_table">
        <caption><b>Table 3</b> Standard names used for industries
        </caption>

    <h2><span id="mid_range_salaries"></span>3. Mid-range salaries</h2>
    <p>
        The job salaries provided by the companies consist in a minimum and maximum values, e.g. €50k - 65k. Thus, in
        order to have one salary number per job post, I converted the range of salaries into a <b>mid-range salary</b>,
        e.g. €50k - 65k --> €57.5
    </p>
    <p>
        Also, all salaries were converted to USD for better comparisons among salaries
        but you must be careful when doing these kinds of comparisons since some places
        (e.g. San Francisco or New York City) have high living costs than others so you
        will expect that these places will offer higher paying wages.
    </p>
    <span id="average_mid_range_salaries"></span>
    <p>
        I used thresholds for ignoring suspicious values: everything outside the range
        [8000, 400000] (USD) was ignored. Some reasons might explain why these
        anomalous salaries appear such as forgetting putting 3 extra 0's (e.g. 10
        instead of 10000), using originally the wrong currency, or simply the pay is not
        that good. I haven't implemented yet an automated method to decide which case
        each suspicious salary range falls into but I will do it eventually. For the
        moment there are very few ranges that get thrown away.
    </p>

    <b>Average mid-range salaries</b>
    <p>The <b>average mid-range salary</b> of an item (e.g. industries, skills) is computed by grouping all the same
        items along with their mid-range salaries and computing the average of their mid-range salaries.</p>

    <h2><span id="todos"></span>4. TODOs</h2>
    <p>Tasks to complete in the short to medium term:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Display jobs data summary directly on each map and graph</li>
        <li>Integrate more jobs data from Stack Overflow</li>
        <li>Generate map plots with plot.ly graphing library so the dots can be clicked on and be shown information such
        as the number of job posts and the min and max salaries for a particular job location</li>
        <li>Generate bar charts as subplots to group them in the same figure</li>
        <li>Enable interactive graphs for mobile devices; right now they don't show correctly at all on mobile devices</li>
        <li>Use a translating service to translate non-english countries (the most common case being German)</li>
    </ul>
