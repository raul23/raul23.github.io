# Welcome!

Here you will find the active projects I am working right now.

For the moment, I am working on a **data mining program** to generate important
insights about developer job posts (e.g. StackOverfow) such as the most popular
technologies and industries. You can find more info about this project at 
[https://raul23.github.io/dev_jobs_insights]().

Here is the list of personal active projects I am working right now:
- [dev_jobs_insights|https://raul23.github.io/dev_jobs_insights]: data mining program for job posts
- [pen_testing](https://github.com/raul23/pen_testing): documentation and small scripts (**not yet!**) for penetration testing

In the near future, these are the projects I will be working on:
- data analysis of crytptocurrencies market
- automatic trading system
- networks monitoring tools
