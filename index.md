# Welcome!

Here you will find the active projects I am working right now.

For the moment, I am working on a **data mining program** to generate important
insights about developer job posts (e.g. StackOverfow) such as the most popular
technologies and industries. You can find more info about this project at 
[https://raul23.github.io/dev_jobs_insights](https://raul23.github.io/dev_jobs_insights).
