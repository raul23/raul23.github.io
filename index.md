# Welcome!

Here you will find links to some of the projects I am working right now and
also past projects.

For the moment, I am working on a personal **data mining project** to generate
important insights about developer job posts (e.g. StackOverfow) such as what are
the most popular technologies and industries. You can find more info about this
project at  [https://raul23.github.io/dev_jobs_insights](https://raul23.github.io/dev_jobs_insights).

Here are the **active** projects I am working right now:
1. **[dev_jobs_insights](https://raul23.github.io/dev_jobs_insights):** data mining
program for job posts
2. **data analysis of cryptocurrencies market:** *no link yet*

These are some projects I am interested to work on eventually if time permits:
- build an automatic trading system: maybe to trade cryptocurrencies
- build network monitoring tools: implement them in Python and bash; analyze 
network traffic and report suspicious activity
- text mining of Wikipedia articles: challenging task because of vast
amount of data
- build a search engine with ElasticSearch: to be deployed on the Wikipedia
text mining project 

<!--Also, you can also check out my blog at TODO: add URL where I talk about 
anything programming related (though I focus more on machine 
learning/data mining in python) TODO: add as a note in the bottom-->
